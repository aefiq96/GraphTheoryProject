# GraphTheoryProject

### OBJECTIVES:
Converting the infixes to postfixes or just getting postfixes

### METHODS: 
I used The Shunting Yard algorithm which converts infix regular expressions to postfix regular expressions. 
and Thompson's algorithm for this project. I also used The Thompson algorithm which basically just shows what each character represents.

### REGEX:
1) . = Concatenating one character directly followed by another character.

2) | = One character or the other.

3) * = The number of whatever that's prior to the *.

4) + = Means at lease one of .

5) ? = Means zero or one of.

### PROCESS:
In the nfa.go file I used the thompson method to convert infixes to postfixes.
In the project.go file I used a switch case for a user to enter their inputs.
When they run the program, they're given two options, either to convert infixes to postfixes or just to get postfixes.
The following project concerns a real-world problem – one that you could be asked to solve in industry. You are not expected 
to know how to do it oﬀ the top of your head. Rather, it is expected that you will research and investigate possible ways to tackle the problem, and then come up with your ownsolutionbasedonthose. Aquicksearchforsolutionsonlinewillconvince youthatmanypeoplehavewrittensolutionstotheproblemalready,inmany diﬀerent programming languages, and many of those are not experienced software developers. Note that a series of videos will be provided to students on the course page to help them with the project.
